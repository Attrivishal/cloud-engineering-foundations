# EC2 Core Components

## Why this topic exists
Every EC2 problem belongs to one core component.

## Core components
- CPU: processing power
- RAM: temporary memory
- Disk: persistent storage
- Network: connectivity

## Real-world thinking
High CPU → compute issue  
Disk full → storage issue  
Not reachable → network/security issue  

## Diagram
EC2 Instance  
[ CPU | RAM | Disk | Network ]

## Interview explanation
"Every EC2 instance consists of compute, memory, storage, and networking."
