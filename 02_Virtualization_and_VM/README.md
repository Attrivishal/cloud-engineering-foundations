# Virtualization and Virtual Machines

## Why this topic exists
Running one application per physical server wastes resources.

## What is a Virtual Machine (VM)?
A VM is a software-based computer that runs inside a physical machine.
It has its own OS and behaves like a real server.

## How virtualization helps
- Multiple VMs on one server
- Better resource utilization
- Isolation between applications

## Real-world example
One powerful server runs 10 VMs instead of buying 10 servers.
