# Cloud Engineering Foundations (Interview + Job Ready)

This repository is a **beginner-to-intermediate learning guide** designed to build
strong **cloud engineering foundations using AWS**, starting from first principles
and progressing toward real-world cloud architectures.

Instead of focusing on memorizing services, this repo emphasizes:
- why concepts exist
- how they work internally
- how they are used in production
- how to explain them confidently in interviews

---

## Who is this for?
- Cloud / AWS freshers
- Students preparing for cloud & infrastructure interviews
- Beginners confused by cloud concepts and architecture
- Anyone who wants strong fundamentals before moving to DevOps or advanced cloud topics

---

## How to use this repository
- Read folders in **numerical order** (learning is progressive)
- Each folder focuses on **one core concept**
- Concepts are explained in **simple, human language**
- Diagrams and architecture explanations are included where needed
- Practice explaining topics aloud to build interview confidence

---

## Learning Philosophy
This repository follows a **foundation-first approach**:

> Understand infrastructure basics → understand AWS services → understand architectures → develop troubleshooting mindset

The goal is to help learners **think like cloud engineers**, not just know service names.

---

## Topics Covered (Growing Progressively)
- Server & virtualization fundamentals
- AWS compute concepts (EC2 and beyond)
- Networking fundamentals (subnets, routing, gateways)
- Security fundamentals (firewalls, security groups, IAM concepts)
- Storage fundamentals (EBS, snapshots, AMIs)
- High availability & scalability concepts
- Load balancing & auto scaling
- Real-world cloud architectures
- Troubleshooting mindset and scenarios

> More AWS services and architectural patterns will be added gradually as the learning progresses.

## What This Repository Is NOT
- ❌ A dump of AWS documentation
- ❌ A service-by-service cheat sheet
- ❌ A shortcut to advanced tools without fundamentals

---

## What You Will Gain
- Strong cloud fundamentals
- Clear architectural thinking
- Confidence in interviews
- A solid base for DevOps, SRE, or advanced cloud learning

---

This repository focuses on **understanding**, not memorization.
