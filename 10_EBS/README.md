# Elastic Block Store (EBS)

## What is EBS?
EBS is persistent block storage for EC2 instances.

## Why EBS is needed
Stores OS, applications, logs, and data.

## Stop vs Terminate
- Stop: data safe
- Terminate: root volume deleted

## Real-world analogy
EBS is like a hard disk attached to a server.
