# Hypervisor

## Why this topic exists
Virtual machines need a manager to share hardware safely.

## What is a hypervisor?
A hypervisor is software that sits between hardware and virtual machines
and allocates CPU, RAM, disk, and network resources.

## Why hypervisor is important
- Enables virtualization
- Ensures isolation
- Prevents one VM from affecting others

## Real-world analogy
A hypervisor is like a building manager who assigns rooms and electricity
to different tenants.
