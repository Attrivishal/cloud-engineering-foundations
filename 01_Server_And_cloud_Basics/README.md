# Server and Cloud Fundamentals

This chapter explains the **basic ideas that exist before any cloud provider
or service**. Understanding these fundamentals is critical before learning
AWS or any other cloud platform.

## 1. What Is a Server?

A server is simply a computer that:
- runs applications or services
- is accessible over a network
- is expected to be available 24/7

There is no technical difference between a normal computer and a server.
A machine becomes a *server* based on **how it is used**, not what it is.

---

## 2. Why Do We Need Servers?

Servers are used to:
- host websites
- run applications
- store and process data
- provide services to users over the internet

Example:
When you open a website, your browser sends a request to a server, and the
server responds with data.

## 3. Problems with Traditional Physical Servers

Before cloud computing, companies managed their own physical servers.

This caused many problems:
- High upfront hardware cost
- Difficult to scale when traffic increases
- Poor resource utilization (servers often idle)
- Hardware failures cause downtime
- Manual maintenance and upgrades

Scaling meant buying new hardware, which takes time.

---

## 4. What Is Cloud Computing (Conceptually)?

Cloud computing means:
- renting computing resources instead of buying hardware
- accessing servers over the internet
- paying only for what you use

Cloud providers manage:
- hardware
- data centers
- power and networking

Users focus on:
- applications
- configuration
- architecture

## 5. Why Cloud Computing Exists

Cloud exists to solve problems of traditional infrastructure:
- fast provisioning
- easy scalability
- lower initial cost
- better reliability
- global access

Instead of weeks, servers can be created in minutes.

## 6. Traditional Infrastructure vs Cloud

### Traditional IT
- Buy hardware
- Install OS manually
- Limited scalability
- High maintenance

### Cloud Infrastructure
- On-demand servers
- Automated provisioning
- Elastic scaling
- Managed infrastructure

---

## 7. Basic Cloud Service Models (High-Level)

At a very high level, cloud services are grouped into:

- **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)**  
  You manage OS and applications (e.g., virtual servers)

- **PaaS (Platform as a Service)**  
  Platform manages OS and runtime

- **SaaS (Software as a Service)**  
  Fully managed applications

At this stage, just understand the concept.
Details will come later.

## 8. Key Takeaway of This Chapter

Before learning any cloud service:
- Understand what a server is
- Understand why cloud exists
- Understand problems cloud solves

This foundation applies to **AWS, Azure, GCP, or any cloud provider**.

## 9. Interview Explanation (Simple & Strong)

"A server is a computer that provides services over a network.
Cloud computing allows us to rent and scale servers on demand without
managing physical hardware."
